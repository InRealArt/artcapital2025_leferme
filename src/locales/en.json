      "text2": "Jean Paul Boyer's captivating sculptures push back the boundaries of contemporary art. Exhibited in France, Europe and as far afield as China, they question the “void”, that elusive element that surrounds and completes matter. Refusing any stylistic label, Boyer explores a multitude of techniques and materials without constraint: wood, metal, marble, cardboard, or anything else she can get her hands on. Each creation is an artistic adventure where audacity meets mastery. To own a work by Jean Paul Boyer is to invite home the essence of innovation and the poetry of the sculptural gesture."

      "words": "”Jean Paul Boyer brings matter to life, capturing the essence of the emptiness that surrounds it. Each sculpture is a unique exploration, where wood, metal, marble, cardboard and other materials are transformed under his hands into striking works of art. His creations reflect a deep reflection on the interplay between space, matter and human emotions. Boyer invites viewers on an introspective journey, to feel the invisible and explore their own perception of art. To own a work by Boyer is to indulge in a fragment of eternity, between innovation, power and sculptural poetry.”",
